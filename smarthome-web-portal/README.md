SmartHome Cloud portal
======================

The SmartHome Cloud portal application was designed to run on a private cloud and was architected with scalability in mind, leveraging open-source projects such as [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) and [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/). Setting it all up is, however, not simple and currently outside the scope of this README.md.

Instead, we recommend you to run the SmartHome Cloud portal using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). There are detailed instructions on how to do that in this [README.md](./tools/docker/README.md).
